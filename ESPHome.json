The WebUI is accessible through the configured port, the ESPHome command line can be used by connecting to the OCI image via <code>docker exec -it esphome /bin/bash</code>.</p><p><b>Note:</b> uses `net=host` and <a href='https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities' target='_blank'>privileged capabilities</a> to enable device connections for firmware updates. Typically, this Rockon would be run during firmware development or updating of devices and, when not needed, be stopped again. It's not necessary to be active for ESP devices  to be recognized by Home Assistant.</p><p>Based on the <a href='https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pkgs/container/esphome' target=_blank>official OCI image</a>, available for amd64 and arm64 architecture.</p>",
