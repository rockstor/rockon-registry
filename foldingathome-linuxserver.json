For the installation, a user account is required (and an account token).</p><p>This Rockon is CPU only by default. GPU folding capability requires: Nvidia drivers & nvidia-OCI installed (untested). See <a href='https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker' target='_blank'>https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker</a>as well as linuxserver's OCI page</p><p><i>It may take a few minutes for your instance to begin contributing & a few more for the details of the project to appear. </i><br>After Rock-on install no further configuration is required for normal function.</p>",
