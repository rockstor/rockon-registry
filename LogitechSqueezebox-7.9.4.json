With the help of many plugins, Logitech Media Server can stream not only your local music collection, but content from many music services and internet radio stations to your players. See <a href='https://mysqueezebox.com/' target='_blank'>https://mysqueezebox.com/</a> and <a href='https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver' target='_blank'>https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver</a> for more information.<h4>Note about UI port</h4><p>Due to some current <a href='https://github.com/rockstor/rockstor-core/issues/2209' target='_blank'>limitations in rock-on networking</a>, the web UI port of this rock-on must be set as 9000 and will thus prevent the installation of other rock-ons needing this port. Alternatively, the web UI can be accessed manually at http://rockstor-ip:9000</p>",
